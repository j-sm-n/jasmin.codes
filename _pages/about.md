## Hey there, the name's Jasmin (no 'e', please)

I'm a Full-Stack Software Engineer currently working at Stitch Fix based out of Los Angeles, CA.

Prior to being a SWE, I was a Project Manager for startups focused on Mobile Development and Marketing. I especially love working on bugs, addressing resiliency improvements to existing solutions and building better engineering cultures.

You can view my résumé [here](jasmin_workman_resume.pdf).

In my spare time, I co-organize the [LA Devs Slack community](http://www.ladevs.org/) focused on connecting developers, designers, strategists and tech leaders in the Greater Los Angeles area.

I like collecting cooking recipes, planning trips around restaurants and bakeries I've been wanting to try, drinking summer drinks in the winter, and spoiling my dog [Noodles](https://www.instagram.com/noodypix/).

If you'd like to reach out to me, feel free to email me at jasmin at hudacsek dot com. You can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/j_sm_n), [DEV](https://dev.to/jsmn), [Github](https://github.com/j-sm-n) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hudacsek/).
