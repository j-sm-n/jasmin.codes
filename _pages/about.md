## Hey there, the name's Jasmin (no 'e', please)

I'm a Full-Stack Software Engineer currently working in eCommerce at StackCommerce in Venice, CA.

Prior to being a SWE, I was a Project Manager for startups focused on Mobile Development and Marketing. I especially love working on bugs, addressing resiliency improvements to existing solutions and building better engineering cultures.

In my spare time, I co-organize the [LA Devs Slack community](http://www.ladevs.org/) focused on connecting developers, designers, strategists and tech leaders in the Greater Los Angeles area.
