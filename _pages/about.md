## About

Hi there, I'm Jasmin Workman! I am a software developer in Denver, CO that specializes in Fullstack development. I, like many others, first fell in love with web development during the days of MySpace and when teaching yourself HTML and CSS was a necessary skill in order to impress all of your friends. This early affection for tinkering on the web eventually led me to want to work in tech full-time but I still have the same passion as I did when I was a kid to deliver delightful and useful user experiences with the code I write.

Outside of work, I like collecting cooking recipes, planning trips around restaurants and bakeries I've been wanting to try, drinking summer drinks in the winter, and spoiling my dog Noodles.
