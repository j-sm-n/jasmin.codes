## Looking Back
### A year ago, what were your expectations for the upcoming year?
- Taking control of my health
- Reading more books for fun
- Growing into and showing my ability to be a tech lead
- Setting more boundaries
- Figuring out my personl style

### What happened in reality, during the year? What were the highlights from the year?
- Had an amazing first trip to Japan with Ry
- Saw lots of concerts, my favorite being seeing Green Day live for the first time
- Started going to therapy
- Started getting real sleep
- I never used "garlic"

### What are the things that went really well?
This year was the first year in a while that I found a primary care doctor who I liked and I was able to figure out a few things about my health, all for the better. I also put effort into finding a therapist for the first time ever, and found one who I can see in person. I can say with confidence that my health was indeed made a priority this year and I am much better off for it.

According to my Goodreads account, I have read 25 books as of this writing this year (hopefully to end with a couple more before the year is up). The year prior, I read a whopping three. So yes, I'd say I've made a great improvement in my goal to read more books.

At work, I've had the chance to showcase my leadership skills while I focus on trying to enact some culture changes as a senior engineer on both my team and the wider org. I've really come to enjoy working on a platform team, and I'm excited what next year can bring. Hopefully, that also means I have some more responsiblity into the new year. 

Lots of boundaries have been set. All of them hard. All of them for the better.

I can happily say that I'm really feeling like I know how to put whole outfits together now. I used to be guilty of just buying one top or pair of pants because I liked them on their own, but never wore them because I couldn't figure out how to turn them into an outfit. I still have some room to grow in this area, but at least I've branched out of my athliesure go-tos a bit more.

### What are the things that could have gone better?
I think I could have been more fearless about setting hard boundaries sooner, but that doesn't feel fair to say. I also could have maintained a close friendship of mine much more consistently, but we are catching up for lost time now.

I also tried to start a Substack but lost steam almost immediately. General malaise kind of set halfway through the year, but I feel like I'm getting out of that funk.

### What have you learned?
I have learned a lot about myself and how I was raised. I still have some things I need to fully acknowledge, but there is a whole lot of unlearning to do next year.

### How did you grow, professionally?
Sometime during this year, I really saw myself switch from being someone who only sought guidance from others to being someone who also is sought to for advice. I feel like as I approach a decade of working as a software engineer, I have grown much more confident in my ability to think critically about technical decisions and practice getting better at "hearding cats." I'm excited to keep honing these skills.

### How did you grow, as a person?
I'm learning that I have people I can depend on and I don't always need to be my own support. I can trust others to take care of me. I also learned that cutting out dysfunctional relationships is very, very hard but very, very worth it.

## Looking Ahead
### What will your priorities be for next year?
- Continue learning to re-parent myself
- Plan my next internaation trip
- Commit to going on my first annual BFF trip
- Enact (and maintain) one big sorely-needed culture change at work across Engineering
- Work on building my chosen family
- Help my community (my first goal is stocking community fridges quarterly)
- Commit to regular writing (I'm looking at you "Snark & Scalability")
  
### What will not be priorities?
- Trying to solve every problem at work
- Trying to solve every problem in life

### What would a great year look like?
BFF Seattle Trip '25 on the books, my next international trip is on the books and/or some development is made in some <INSERT PERSONAL GOAL HERE>. 

### What are things that you have learned from last year, and will do differently?
A lot of things are out of my control. I spent a lot of time this past year trying to over-prepare for some things I thought I had more control over. I will be more gentle with myself this time.

### If you can only set one goal for the year, what will it be?
It feels nebulolus to try and describe, but my main goal is to learn how to re-parent myself. That sounds hokey to say outloud, but that's what I've got.
