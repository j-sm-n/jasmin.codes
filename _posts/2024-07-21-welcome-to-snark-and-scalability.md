> I'm starting a Substack (second time's the charm) and it's mostly going to be focused on the latest thing I'm dumbfounded by in tech or how I see engineering organizations making weird decisions. Enjoy the first post here and follow me on [Substack](https://snarkandscalability.substack.com) for more! I'll probably try cross-posting here just in case Substack decides to paywall everyone or steal my intellectual property for some reason. - Jaz

Welcome to Snark & Scalability, where we navigate the strange and sometimes wonderful world of tech. If you're here, you're probably knee-deep in JIRA tickets, recovering from your 3AM incident page for the third day in a row, or just trying to get a sense of how other engineering orgs seem to have their shit together (surprise, they probably don't).

Here at S&S, we'll dive into the glorious mess Gordon Ramsey-style[^1] of scaling engineering teams, the latest tech trends that everyone pretends to understand, and the everyday absurdities of being an individual contributor in this unpredictable industry. Expect rants, laughs, and maybe a few too many references to the joys of dealing with legacy code.

Let's be real: we're living in weird times. We have AI writing poems, companies racing to build the next big thing without actually knowing what that thing is, and a job market that can't decide if it loves or hates software engineers. It's like being in a never-ending episode of Black Mirror, but with more Slack messages.

So, strap in and join me on this journey through the fun times and comical realities of tech life. Whether you're a seasoned engineer, a curious newbie, or just someone who loves a good snarky take on the latest tech news, there's something here for you. Together, we'll laugh, we'll cry (mostly from another failing background job clogging up your CPU), and we'll figure out how to build something amazing in this beautifully chaotic industry.

If you're ready for a dose of reality mixed with a healthy serving of humor, subscribe to our [Substack](https://snarkandscalability.substack.com) or [RSS feed](/feed.xml) and join the Snark & Scalability community. Let's make sense of this tech world together--one snarky post at a time.
